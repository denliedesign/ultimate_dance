        <p>
            ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA began in the hustle and bustle of South Florida.  Founded in 1993 by Annette Alvarez, ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA opened its doors with professional instructors in a beautiful location in South Florida. After 10 successful years, Ms. Annette decided it was time to move to a smaller, family oriented  town and chose the Space Coast as the location. Upon their move, ULTIMATE DANCE in Melbourne was opened to offer students in east Central Florida the opportunity to experience dance training on a new level, with cutting edge choreography, professional level faculty and high expectations.
{{--            In the summer of 2011, we were excited to open our second location,  ULTIMATE DANCE in Viera, the premiere dance studio within the Viera community.--}}
