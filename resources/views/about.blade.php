        <p>
            ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA began in the hustle and bustle of South Florida.  Founded in 1993 by Annette Alvarez-Gutches, ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA opened its doors with professional instructors in a beautiful location in South Florida. After 10 successful years, Ms. Annette and her husband Brad decided it was time to move to a smaller, family oriented  town and chose the Space Coast as the location. Upon their move, ULTIMATE DANCE in Melbourne was opened to offer students in east Central Florida the opportunity to experience dance training on a new level, with cutting edge choreography, professional level faculty and high expectations. In the summer of 2011, we were excited to open our second location,  ULTIMATE DANCE in Viera, the premiere dance studio within the Viera community.
            <br><br>
            ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA is proud to be recognized as one of the TOP 50 STUDIOS in the SE United States by The Federation of Dance Competitions.
            <br><br>
            ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA is a highly successful and well-respected dance studio with an enrollment of dancers from beginner to professional level. What sets this studio apart from the rest is a team of experienced, enthusiastic, highly energetic professional instructors who are loyal, dedicated, and committed to each student individually. This combined with the expertise and artistic vision of Annette Alvarez-Gutches has brought dance in Brevard county to the next level.
            <br><br>
            Both locations are fully equipped with state-of-the-art technology, floating dance floors with marley surfaces, and viewing windows for parents peace of mind.
            <br><br>
            Classes are educational and provided superior instruction at all levels in jazz, tap, ballet, acrobatics, hip-hop, musical theater, contemporary, lyrical, and specialty classes. We offer discounts for multiple children. Classes are offered six days a week, at various times. Here at ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA, your choices are maximized.
            <br><br>
            All classes are taught by an experienced professional staff, and in some classes, assisted by advanced level dancers. At ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA, we strive to teach the art of dance at its highest level in a positive motivating atmosphere. From the beginner child or adult to the professional dancer, ULTIMATE DANCE has a class for you.
            <br><br>
            While having fun dancing, students develop physical fitness, self-discipline, social skills, sportsmanship, team work, respect, and responsibility. Part of the excitement is participating in numerous regional and national competitions at which ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA students are always winners.
            <br><br>
            However, the ULTIMATE DANCE FLORIDA commitment runs deeper than winning awards. Students are encouraged and positively guided through a caring and dedicated faculty to be their best. The focus is on providing an excellent dance program in a safe, family-oriented environment conducive to learning- for the future of Brevard’s dancers.

                <br>

                <br>
                Karis’ love for dance began on Long Island, NY at the age of three.Although she was mostly trained at June Claire Dance Studio, a studio run by former Rockettes Lynda Gache and June Loesche, a studio  known for its focus on classical training and Broadway productions, Karis further supplemented her education at Frank Ohman’s School of Ballet and Eglevsky School of Ballet.  As Karis’ love for dance grew (and as she became old enough to take the train into the city by herself) she diversified her education, venturing into Manhattan where she studied at Broadway Dance Center, Steps on Broadway, Alvin Ailey, Paul Taylor and Barnard College at Columbia University. Karis has performed in annual televised Holiday events, ballets,  community theater, the Tribeca Film Festival and has appeared in such films as “Elf” and “School of Rock.”  She has worked with such notable names as Michael Trusnovec, Loyd Culbreath and Andrea Kron.
