                    Ballet is fundamental to ALL forms of dance. While we incorporate various methods and expose our dancers to various schools, we expose students to ABT philosophies.

{{--                    This class is all about the funk! Hip hop dance refers to dance styles, mainly street dance styles, primarily danced to hip hop music, or that have evolved as a part of the hip hop culture. The first and original dance associated with hip hop is breakdance, which appeared in New York City during the early 1970s and truly became a cornerstone (or "element") of hip hop as a culture. In the 1990s, as hip hop music took new forms, new dance styles began appearing, most of them danced in an upright manner in contrast to breakdance with its many ground moves. These later styles are sometimes referred to as new school or new style while the older styles, including breakdance and various funk styles that were incorporated into hip hop, are considered old school.
