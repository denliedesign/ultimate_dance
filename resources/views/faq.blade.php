            The PROFESSIONAL Staff at Ultimate Dance Florida is extremely careful and dedicated to choosing the correct class level and placement for each student. It is very important to remember that all students are individuals with very different talents, skills, and ability levels and they will not all progress at the same rate. The most important thing is that the student "enjoys" the class and "feels comfortable" in it and is "happy". A "happy" learning environment is sure to yield progress. Ultimate Dance Florida is a very progressive school and all of our classes are challenging in different ways.

                <span class="txt-burg-light fw-bold text-uppercase">Class placement is the teacher's/director's decision.</span>
                After all, that's what he/she is trained to do. Unlike academics, where progress can sometimes be measured with a score or a grade, dance progress cannot be measured as simply. There are many factors that cannot be judged by the untrained eye - flexibility, natural ability for movement, the speed at which a dancer picks up choreography, musicality, performance quality, command of a room or stage, and technical execution.

                Not all studios follow the same level structure and therefore if transferring from another studio, it doesn’t mean you will be placed in the same level from your old studio.  Please trust the process of this placement and know that we work to find the best level for all dancers to thrive and grow.

                <span class="txt-burg-light fw-bold text-uppercase">Did you know that there is no certification required in this country to open a dance school?</span>
                Because of this, Ultimate Dance Florida has established itself as an institution of "excellence in the performing arts" and is recognized nationally as such. We pride ourselves on the training and excellence of our staff.  Annette Alvarez is certified by both Dance Masters of America and Florida Dance Masters, the largest and most prestigious dance teacher organizations in the United States. The entire staff teaches from their many years of dance and music experience and performance training. Many are members of professional performing arts organizations as well.

                <span class="txt-burg-light fw-bold text-uppercase">Training Hours and Frequency</span>
                The number of times a student studies per week, and his/her attendance may also have an important influence on how quickly he or she progresses. We sometimes find that many students who have taken ballet for several years are usually able to work at a higher level in tap and jazz than those that have had little or no ballet training. This is because ballet encompasses all the fundamentals of dance movement.

                Ultimate Dance Florida prides itself on having a "friendly" and "family-like" atmosphere with enough strong dancers & teachers to help each dancer develop into the best that he or she can and wants to be. From time to time, our teachers must make decisions whereby certain students are chosen for solos, competition groups, special parts or special auditions. These decisions are not easily made and are thought out carefully. The parents and teachers must work together to help students understand that not all students can be chosen for all things. When the teachers think that a particular student is ready for a certain endeavor, the parents will be informed. We want our students to be "happy for" and not "jealous of" each other. It is our intention to teach the students to learn from each other and to be motivated by each other. We at Ultimate Dance Florida sincerely try to give as many students as are ready, "special dance experiences". Again we stress - all students are not equally talented, but there is always a place for dancers of all levels!

                In the past 25 years, the dance world has changed immensely. Dance competitions and conventions have become a major force in the dance world, and we feel (along with America’s other top schools) that when handled correctly without undue pressure, competitions are a fun and exciting way for the dancers to show off their abilities and hard work, to be educated by seeing other top-level students, and to become friends with well-known teachers, performers, and choreographers.
                <br><br>The Team provides this opportunity for students (ages 5-18) who wish to take part in an accelerated program of study, and also perform locally and compete regionally and nationally. New members are selected each summer through our audition process and receive written invitations to join. Those who accept then participate in Summer Training/Dance Intensive, study all forms of dance for up to ten hours a week during the dance year, and also work on choreography, putting together the innovative and precise routines that they have become known for in preparation for performances and competitions.
                <br><br>In just a few years, the Team have earned a reputation as one of the top "competition teams" in the area, winning praise from top professionals and other teachers for our technique, performance quality, costumes, and choreography. Just as important is the recognition we have received for our "age-appropriate" dances and for having the "best sportmanship", truly happy for all the dancers they compete with and against!
                <br><br>EVERY Team dancer MUST participate in a mandatory Summer Dance classes and Intensive.

                    Do I have to sign a contract?
                </span>
                NO!! That would be crazy!! We are a performing arts studio for children (and adults) and realize children change their mind about things. Sometimes it just becomes necessary to drop a class or dance all together for a while. All we ask for is our withdrawal form completed with our office staff before the 1st of the month, so that we can open up your spot to another dancer and halt your auto-pay for the following month. And of course you are always welcome back (pending room in the class)! {auto-pay is deactivated 30 days after the office receives the DROP Form}

What is your dance season?

Do you have a dress code?
                </span>
                Yes we do. Dance is a disciplined art and we do believe in a dress code for our students. However, we do not believe in ranking or leveling them by color, as in our opinion, building self confidence and a family atmosphere is more important than the color of the leotard a dancer wears. All of our dancers wear burgundy, regardless of "level". Please see our dress code for more specifics. We do expect all dancers to be in dress code by September 1.

                ABSOLUTELY! All of our teachers are adults and professionals in the industry. We do have experienced, advanced level teens who assist in many of our classes. We also offer our qualified Seniors who have trained with us for many years the opportunity to "Apprentice Teach" certain classes. These dancers have met rigorous requirements set forth by Ms. Annette, and have shown an interest and desire to share their knowledge through teaching.

We do not charge a recital fee, however we do have a media fee, which includes a link to the actual recital . Everyone does require a ticket to the show, and of course you will have to purchase a costume and recital finale shirt!

In maintaining a high quality of dance and music education, it is therefore sometimes impossible to keep the same students together in a class year after year.

Class placement is the teacher's/director's decision. After all, that's what he/she is trained to do. We cannot stress enough that since every child is not equally talented, they cannot all show the same progress rate. In addition, dance teachers know from experience that some children progress faster as part of the "top half" of a class, while others progress faster in the "bottom/younger/newer" half of a class. Unlike academics, where progress can sometimes be measured with a score or a grade, dance progress cannot be measured as simply. There are many factors that cannot be judged by the untrained eye - flexibility, natural ability for movement, the speed at which a dancer picks up choreography, his/her ear for music & beat, his/her performance quality, command of a room or stage, and also the actual skill level & step vocabulary he/she posesses. Many students "know" many steps, but do not yet have the technique or musicality to execute them with style, which is key in dance. (In other words, we don't just move dancers "up" because they "know" or "can do the step," but base our choices as much if not more on the quality of how it is done - whether it can be done in combination, with style, and with control.) These are the things that make dance an art, not just a sport.--}}

Children of these types of parents usually become so frustrated with their dancing that they "quit" and never realize that dancing is supposed to be "fun". These children almost always perceive themselves as "failures" because they can never live up to their parents "impossible" expectations for them. What a shame - dance builds grace, confidence, posture and balance, and is a lot of fun - not every child who dances for a year or fifteen years will become a professional, but the memories & benefits last a lifetime!--}}

Therefore, she should be in your most advanced classes too!" This may or may not be true. There is no certification required in this country to open a dance school and because of this, the training of our Nation's teachers ranges from excellent to horrible.

It is normal for every parent to view his or her child as "the best dancer in the class", but remember, the teacher is looking at your child through trained, expert eyes.

{{--                <span class="txt-burg-light fw-bold">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</span> The number of times a student studies per week, and his/her attendance may also have an important influence on how quickly he or she progresses. For instance, a student who has studied jazz dancing for five years on a once a week basis may find himself/herself in a class with a student who has studied jazz for only one or two years but has also been taking ballet and tap classes. Naturally, the second student has been dancing more intensively and this will tend to speed up progress. On the other hand, there are limits to how many classes dancers should take. Even with intensive- level dancers who push their bodies to accomplish many difficult skills, it is important to have AT LEAST two free days during the week with no classes to avoid physical and/or psychological burnout or injury.  We sometimes find that many students who have taken ballet for several years are usually able to work at a higher level in tap and jazz than those that have had little or no ballet training. This is because ballet encompasses all the fundamentals of dance movement.--}}

{{--                NO!! That would be crazy!! We are a performing arts studio for children  (and adults) and realize children change their mind about things. Sometimes it just becomes necessary to drop a class or dance all together for a while. All we ask for is our withdrawal form completed with our office staff before the 1st of the month, so that we can open up your spot to another dancer and halt your auto-pay for the following month. And of course you are always welcome back (pending room in the class)! {auto-pay is deactivated 30 days after the office receives the DROP Form}--}}

{{--                <span class="txt-burg-light fw-bold">Do you have a dress code?</span>--}}
{{--                Yes we do. Dance is a disciplined art and we do believe in a dress code for our students. However, we do not believe is ranking or leveling them by color, as in our opinion, building self confidence and a family atmosphere is more important than the color of the leotard a dancer wears. All our our  wear burgundy, regardless of "level". Please see our dress code for more specifics. We do expect all dancers to be in dress code by September 1.--}}

{{--                We think this is a funny question but we seem to be getting it a lot! Yes, our Suntree  lobby is a very cool temperature (and actually pretty cold after 7-ish!) for those waiting. Our Palm Bay/Melbourne lobby is very nicely appointed as well. We recommend you bring a water bottle, to refill,  as we have filtered water but do not supply cups!--}}

{{--                We hold auditions for this very prestigious team every summer. If you missed auditions, but would like to be a part of the team, you can contact Ms. Annette for a private audition. We would love to have you! However, once we begin choreography, all teams are closed to new members for that year.--}}

{{--                ABSOLUTELY! All of our teachers are adults and professionals in the industry. We do have experienced, advanced level teens who assistant in many of our classes. We also offer our qualified Seniors who have trained with us for many years the opportunity to "Apprentice Teach" certain classes. These dancers have met rigorous requirements set forth by Ms. Annette, and have shown an interest and desire to share their knowledge through teaching.--}}

Please do not allow children to stand on chairs to see in the rooms as it is both dangerous and distracting! <strong>ALL VIEWING IS COVERED FROM VALENTINE'S DAY on for our teachers to work on and perfect recital dances!</strong> They are a surprise for the audience that way!! <small>*no viewing window in room 2 in Melbourne</small>--}}

{{--                Yes, we produce a year end dance show every fall dance season. Each location will have it's own show. This is a great time for dancers to show what they have learned in class! We do not charge a recital fee, however we do have a media fee, which includes a link to the actual recital .  Everyone does require a ticket to the show, and of course you will have to purchase a costume and recital finale shirt!--}}
